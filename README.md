Fake News Detection Chatbot
This project is a simple Streamlit web app that uses a fine-tuned BERT model to detect whether a given news article/snippet is real or fake. It takes user input, processes it using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library, and predicts the news authenticity along with confidence scores.

The idea behind this project is to help users quickly verify the credibility of news and avoid misinformation.
